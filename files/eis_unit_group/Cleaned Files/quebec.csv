Abbreviation notes:

List of abbreviations and acronyms found within various Census products.
(https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/symb-ab-acr-eng.cfm)



iBall:
i6,"Geography name: Quebec; Geographic area type: Province; Geographic area type abbreviation: PR; Geographic level: Province or territory; Province or territory abbreviation: Que.; Dissemination Geography Unique Identifier (DGUID): 2021A000224; Alternative geographic code: 24; Province or territory geocode: 24; Long-form total non-response rate: 3.7; Data quality flag: 20000; Data quality note: Excludes census data for one or more incompletely enumerated reserves or settlements."



Footnotes:
1,"The concept of work activity is derived based on responses to the number of weeks worked during the reference year and during those weeks worked in 2020, if the individual worked mostly full-time or part-time. The work activity concept uses the reference year January to December 2020, as does census income data.  As a result, when comparing to income data, there could be workers reporting a certain number of weeks worked in 2020 without any earnings reported for that year. There could also be workers who did not report any work activity (no weeks worked) in 2020 but did have earnings in that year. Although it is possible to have pre-payment or retroactive pay of employment income, it is uncertain if the extent of such arrangements is captured accurately in the long-form questionnaire. Moreover, some self-employed workers receive dividends instead of earnings and proxy reporting as well as respondents' inaccurate recall for the year 2020 could also be contributing factors to explain these inconsistencies."
2,"Visible minority  Visible minority refers to whether a person is a visible minority or not, as defined by the Employment Equity Act. The Employment Equity Act defines visible minorities as "persons, other than Aboriginal peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour." The visible minority population consists mainly of the following groups: South Asian, Chinese, Black, Filipino, Arab, Latin American, Southeast Asian, West Asian, Korean and Japanese."
3,"Highest certificate, diploma or degree  Highest certificate, diploma or degree is the classification used in the census to measure the broader concept of 'Educational attainment.'  This variable refers to the highest level of education that a person has successfully completed and is derived from the educational qualifications questions, which asked for all certificates, diplomas and degrees to be reported.  The general hierarchy used in deriving this variable (high school, trades, college, university) is loosely tied to the 'in-class' duration of the various types of education. At the detailed level, someone who has completed one type of certificate, diploma or degree will not necessarily have completed the credentials listed below it in the hierarchy. For example, a person with an apprenticeship or trades certificate or diploma may not have completed a high school certificate or diploma, nor does an individual with a 'master's degree' necessarily have a 'university certificate or diploma above bachelor level.' Although the hierarchy may not fit all programs perfectly, it gives a general measure of educational attainment.  This variable is reported for persons aged 15 years and over in private households."
4,"Work activity during the reference year    'Work activity during the reference year' refers to whether or not a person 15 years or over worked during the reference year. For those who did work, this refers to the number of weeks in which the person worked for pay or in self-employment during the reference year at all jobs held, even if only for a few hours, and whether these weeks were mostly full time (30 hours or more per week) or mostly part time (less than 30 hours per week)."
5,"Age  Age refers to the age of a person (or subject) of interest at last birthday (or relative to a specified, well-defined reference date).  Gender  Gender refers to an individual's personal and social identity as a man, woman or non-binary person (a person who is not exclusively a man or a woman).  Gender includes the following concepts:  gender identity, which refers to the gender that a person feels internally and individually;  gender expression, which refers to the way a person presents their gender, regardless of their gender identity, through body language, aesthetic choices or accessories (e.g., clothes, hairstyle and makeup), which may have traditionally been associated with a specific gender.  A person's gender may differ from their sex at birth, and from what is indicated on their current identification or legal documents such as their birth certificate, passport or driver's licence. A person's gender may change over time.  Some people may not identify with a specific gender.  Given that the non-binary population is small, data aggregation to a two-category gender variable is sometimes necessary to protect the confidentiality of responses provided. In these cases, individuals in the category “non-binary persons” are distributed into the other two gender categories and are denoted by the “+” symbol."
6,""Visible minority" refers to whether a person is a visible minority or not, as defined by the Employment Equity Act. The Employment Equity Act defines visible minorities as "persons, other than Aboriginal peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour." The visible minority population consists mainly of the following groups: South Asian, Chinese, Black, Filipino, Arab, Latin American, Southeast Asian, West Asian, Korean and Japanese.   In 2021 Census analytical and communications products, the term "visible minority" has been replaced by the terms "racialized population" or "racialized groups", reflecting the increased use of these terms in the public sphere."
7,"For more information on visible minority and population group variables, including information on their classifications, the questions from which they are derived, data quality and their comparability with other sources of data, please refer to the Visible Minority and Population Group Reference Guide, Census of Population, 2021."
8,"For information on data quality for this variable, refer to the Education Reference Guide, Census of Population, 2021, Catalogue no. 98-500-X2021013."
9,"Refers to the number of weeks in which a person aged 15 years and over worked for pay or in self-employment in 2020 at all jobs held, even if only for a few hours, and whether these weeks were mostly full time (30 hours or more per week) or mostly part time (less than 30 hours per week)."
11,"Employment income - All income received as wages, salaries and commissions from paid employment and net self-employment income from farm or non-farm unincorporated business and/or professional practice during the reference period. For the 2021 Census, the reference period for income data is the calendar year 2020, unless otherwise specified."
12,"The median income of a specified group is the amount that divides the income distribution of that group into two halves, i.e., the incomes of half of the units in that group are below the median, while those of the other half are above the median. Median incomes of individuals are calculated for those with income (positive or negative)."
13,"Average income of a specified group is calculated by dividing the aggregate income of that group by the number of units in that group. Average incomes are calculated for those with income (positive or negative)."
10,"Occupation (based on the National Occupational Classification [NOC] 2021 Version 1.0)  Occupation refers to the kind of work performed in a job, a job being all the tasks carried out by a particular worker to complete his or her duties. An occupation is a set of jobs that are sufficiently similar in work performed.  Kind of work is described in terms of tasks, duties and responsibilities, often including factors such as materials processed or used, the industrial processes used, the equipment used, and the products or services provided. Occupations are generally homogeneous with respect to skill type and skill level.  Occupation applies to the contribution of labour to that part of economic activity that is within the production boundary defined for the System of National Accounts."
14,"Refers to the kind of work performed by persons aged 15 years and over as determined by their kind of work and the description of the main activities in their job. The occupation data are produced according to the National Occupational Classification [NOC] 2021 version 1.0.  Occupation codes are based on write-in descriptions of the respondents’ job title and main duties/responsibilities. Incomplete or vague write-in responses can reduce the accuracy of the codes assigned, particularly for the most detailed levels of the occupation classification. For example, when ‘sales’ is provided as a description of main duties or responsibilities, any one of the codes corresponding to sales associate, sales supervisor or sales manager could be assigned.  The potential for inaccuracy in occupation codes is elevated for smaller domains, when increased sampling variability also impacts the accuracy of estimates. In such situations, users are advised to consider using broader occupation categories."
15,"Census 2021 National Occupational Classification (NOC) code exception: The code and title of this category are not found in the NOC 2021; this category includes codes 00011-00015."
