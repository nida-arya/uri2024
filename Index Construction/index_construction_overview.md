This folder contains code and data for a teleworkability index, based on NOC 2021.

# Methodology

I employed a methodology similar to that in Gallacher and Hossain's paper. Given that Gallacher and Hossain's paper had a remote work index with NOC 2016 codes, I mapped these to NOC 2021 codes. These were then used to develop a teleworkability index for NOC 43 and NOC 10, a broader occupational classification used in the Labour Force Survey.

There were discrepancies in employment statistics between the 2016 and 2021 census, particularly due to the absence of occupation unit group data for senior managers. To address this, I instead used a teleworkability index for Legislators and Senior Managers directly from Gallacher and Hossain's paper.
